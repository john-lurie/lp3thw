""" Study Drill 2: 
Learn about Python's 'doc tests', and see if you like them better.

To use doctest, put three greater-than signs in front of the code you
wish to test, followed by the expected output.

>>> greek_letter("alpha")
'Î±'

Then include the if-statement at the bottom of this module.

To run the test: "$ python try_doctest.py"
If no output, then all the tests passed.
Run "$ python try_doctest.py -v" for verbose output.
